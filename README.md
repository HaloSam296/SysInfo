# SysInfo
A C and Bash program for my CS351 Final Project. It's intended to be run on Debian machines to give the user system information and was tested on Kali and Ubuntu machines. 

The class only allows for READMEs to be in .txt format, leading to this unfortunate case where there are two READMEs. This one explains the GitHub, the other explains the program. Please note that some things are a little odd. An example is the How-To guide, which deviates from many How-To's in that is explains how some of the code and program logic works. This is due to requirements in the class. 


Update:
This program is now "complete" as the final deadline for the project has just passed. I'm not entirely happy with how it turned out, but personal matters stole most of the time I had for this away. Still, I'm somewhat satisfied with how this turned out. It's not terrible, it's just not great.
