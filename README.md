# SysInfo
A C and Bash program for my CS351 Final Project. Intended to be run on Debian machines to give the user system information. Tested on Kali and Ubuntu machines. 

The class only allows for READMEs to be in .txt format, leading to this unfortunate case where there are two READMEs. This one explains the GitHub, the other explains the program.
