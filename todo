To-Do:

 - Learn git and create GitHub repo

 - Change avgTemp to use lm-sensors

 - Finish How-To

 - Thoroughly test and refine current project to prepare for project 3

 - Reorganize Bash scripts
		Make a single script to check and install any needed packages
		Then keep avgTemp in its own scripts, no package checks necessary

 - Modify an existing bash script or create a new one that can be edited
	within the C program to output different results. 

	- This modification must be able to be specifically set by the 
		user

	- The users must be able to verify within the C program that 
		the changes have successfully been made

For the Bash Script modification:
	Use two copies of the script. First is an original copy and the 
	second is the modified copy. This lets the original be the base
	that can be compared against by any subsequent copies, to test for
	modifications.
